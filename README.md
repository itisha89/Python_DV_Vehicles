## Project Overview

The provided dataset contains the sales data of various vehicle categories in India from 2001 to 2013. The goal of this project is to analyze the production trends of different vehicle categories and segments, focusing on the following aspects:

1. **Compare the production of passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles** in India from 2001-02 to 2012-13.
2. **Analyze the passenger vehicle production (segment-wise)** from 2001-02 to 2012-13.
3. **Compare the production of 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers** in India from 2001-02 to 2012-13.
4. **Analyze the 2-wheeler production** in India (segment-wise) during 2001-02 to 2012-13.
5. **Analyze the 3-wheeler production** in India (segment-wise) during 2001-02 to 2012-13.
6. **Analyze the production of passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, 3-wheelers, and 2-wheelers** in India (segment-wise) from 2001-02 to 2012-13.

### Business Goals:
- **Visual Comparisons**: Create visualizations that compare the production trends of passenger vehicles vs commercial vehicles, 2-wheelers vs 3-wheelers, and segment-wise trends for these vehicle categories.
- **Gestalt Principles**: Ensure that the visualizations adhere to Gestalt's principles of perception, which include proximity, similarity, continuity, closure, and figure-ground. Additionally, utilize pre-attentive attributes like color, size, and shape to enhance the comprehension of key insights.
  
## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Category**: The broad vehicle category (e.g., Passenger Vehicles, Commercial Vehicles, etc.).
- **Segment**: The specific type of vehicle within each category (e.g., Passenger Cars, Multi-Utility Vehicles, Goods Carriers, etc.).
- **Years**: The columns spanning from 2001-02 to 2012-13, representing the sales figures for each segment.

### Key Findings:
1. **Vehicle Categories**:
   - **Passenger Vehicles (PVs)**
   - **Commercial Vehicles (CVs)**
   - **Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs)**
   - **Three Wheelers**
   - **Two Wheelers**
   
2. **Segments** within each category:
   - Passenger Cars, Multi-Utility Vehicles, Scooters, Motorcycles, Mopeds, and Electric Two Wheelers are the primary segments.

3. **Missing Values**: 
   - Some segments have missing values in certain years, which have been addressed through data cleaning.

4. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Missing values in the dataset were identified and cleaned, ensuring all years from 2001-02 to 2012-13 are now accounted for.

5. **No Duplicates** were found after cleaning.

### Null/Missing Values Check
- **Before Cleaning**:
  Missing values were found for several segments, particularly in years 2010-11 to 2012-13 for certain segments.
  
- **After Cleaning**:
  All missing values were addressed, and the dataset is now free of null entries.

## Business Problem

The task is to generate visual insights that can help understand the trends in vehicle production across different categories and segments over the years.

### Visual Analysis Objectives:
1. **Overall Vehicle Production Comparison**:
   Compare the total production of **Passenger Vehicles (PVs)** and **Commercial Vehicles (CVs)** over the years in a single visual.

2. **Segment-wise Analysis of Passenger Vehicles**:
   Analyze the production of passenger vehicles, breaking them down into **Passenger Cars** and **Multi-Utility Vehicles**.

3. **2-Wheeler vs. 3-Wheeler Production**:
   Compare the total production of **Two Wheelers** (including Scooters, Motorcycles, and Mopeds) vs **Three Wheelers** (including both Passenger and Goods Carriers).

4. **Segment-wise Analysis of Two Wheelers**:
   Analyze the production of **Two Wheelers** broken down into **Scooters**, **Motorcycles/Step-throughs**, and **Mopeds**.

5. **Segment-wise Analysis of Three Wheelers**:
   Analyze the production of **Three Wheelers**, focusing on both **Passenger Carriers** and **Goods Carriers**.

6. **Comprehensive Analysis of All Vehicle Categories**:
   Provide a visual representation comparing the production trends for **Passenger Vehicles**, **Commercial Vehicles**, **Three Wheelers**, and **Two Wheelers**, segment-wise.

## Visual Justification Using Gestalt's Principles

The visualizations will adhere to **Gestalt's Principles** and **Pre-attentive Attributes** to ensure clarity and engagement:

1. **Proximity**:
   - Related data points will be placed closer together to show their connection, such as placing all two-wheeler segments near each other in a grouped visual.

2. **Similarity**:
   - Similar data will be represented using similar colors, shapes, or sizes. For example, all segments of two-wheelers will use a similar color scheme.

3. **Continuity**:
   - The trend lines for each category will be continuous to represent the flow of production data over the years.

4. **Closure**:
   - The visual design will avoid excessive clutter, ensuring that viewers can intuitively understand the completion of trends, like consistent year-over-year growth.

5. **Figure-Ground**:
   - Important data (such as high production years) will be highlighted using contrasting colors, ensuring they stand out against less significant data points.

6. **Pre-attentive Attributes**:
   - Colors: Different categories will have distinct color palettes.
   - Size: The size of markers/lines can vary based on the production volume.
   - Shape: Different shapes will differentiate between the various vehicle categories and segments.
